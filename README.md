- Run the following script to install chrome headless browser:
- To ensure everything is working properly do example.com for a quick test
- The requirements.txt file contains the packages required for this pipeline to work
- How to set up virtual enviornment with make update
- 



Use the script from last lab to install chrome headless browser. Use example.com for a quick test.
Mention requirements.txt file. At this point we only need pandas and lxml
Now turn to the makefile, document how to set up your virtual environment with make update
Add a quick section to run a job in your makefile to test the headless browser like make ygainers.csv
Finally run tree <your project-repo> -I env and copy the output to show the reader what your structure looks like.
